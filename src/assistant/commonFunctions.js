      # Growth Patterns 

      - Explosion: A central origin point from which multiple straight lines extend outward in all directions, suggesting radial expansion.
      - Spiral: A curve that originates from a central point and progressively moves away, creating a coiling pattern that can be either tight or loose.
      - Branching: A pattern that mimics the structure of branching in trees or veins, where a main line splits into multiple subsidiary lines.
      - Meander: A continuous, serpentine line that creates a sequence of loops or turns, often symmetric and evenly spaced.
      - Wave: A pattern consisting of smoothly undulating lines that create peaks and troughs akin to waves in water.
      - Parallel: Multiple lines that run side by side at a uniform distance from each other, never converging or diverging.
      - Tiling: Repeated geometric shapes fitted together without gaps or overlaps, covering a plane.
      - Bubble: A cluster of rounded shapes, each resembling a bubble, which may vary in size and proximity to each other.

      # Geometric Patterns

      - Triangle: A three-sided polygon with three corners and edges, with varying side lengths and angles.
      - Square: A four-sided polygon with equal side lengths and right angles at each corner.
      - Pentagon: A five-sided polygon with five corners and edges, with varying side lengths and angles.
      - Hexagon: A six-sided polygon typically with equal side lengths and angles.
      - Octagon: An eight-sided polygon with eight edges and corners, which can vary in the lengths of its sides and sizes of its angles.
      - Circle: A shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a constant distance from a center point.
      - Ellipse: An elongated circle, also known as an oval, characterized by a closed curve in which the sum of the distances from two points (foci) to any point on the curve is constant.

      # Symmetric and Asymmetric Patterns

      - Asymmetry: A pattern or shape lacking symmetry, with unequal distribution of parts or elements within the shape.
      - Chirality: Objects that are non-superimposable on their mirror images, often referred to as ‘handedness’ in structures.
      - Bilateral symmetry: A characteristic where a shape or pattern can be divided into two mirror-image sides along a central axis.
      - Symmetry in 3: A shape that can be divided into three symmetrical sections typically around a central point.
      - Symmetry in 4: A shape with four lines of symmetry, allowing it to be divided into four identical sections.
      - Symmetry in 5: A shape with five lines of symmetry, segmenting the shape into five symmetrical parts.
      - Symmetry in 6: A shape that exhibits six lines of symmetry, creating six equivalent sections.
      - Symmetry in 7: A shape with seven lines of symmetry, each dividing the shape into congruent sections.
      - Symmetry in 8: A shape that features eight lines of symmetry, segmenting the shape into eight identical pieces.

      # Pattern Building Blocks

      - 1 point: A singular position in space marked by a dot, representing the simplest geometric element.
      - 2 points: Two distinct positions in space, typically marked by dots and can define a line segment when connected.
      - Line: A one-dimensional figure extending infinitely in both directions, represented by a straight path.
      - Angle: A geometric figure created by two lines originating from the same point, creating a space between them.
      - Fraction: A numerical representation of a part of a whole, expressed with a numerator and a denominator.
      - Curve: Any smooth, continuously bending line or shape that deviates from being straight.
      - Parabola: A specific curved shape defined by a set of points equidistant from a focal point and a directrix.
      - Infinity: A concept represented by a figure-eight lying on its side, symbolizing endlessness or boundlessness.
