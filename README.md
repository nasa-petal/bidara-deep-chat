BIDARA can guide users through the Biomimicry Instituteâ€™s [Design Process](https://toolbox.biomimicry.org/methods/process/), a step-by-step method to propose biomimetic solutions to challenges. This process includes defining the problem, biologizing the challenge, discovering natural models, abstracting design strategies, and emulating nature's lessons.

## :computer: For developers

`bidara-deep-chat` is a front-end web app that uses Svelte and [the deep-chat web component](https://github.com/OvidijusParsiunas/deep-chat) to connect directly to BIDARA over the OpenAI Assistants API (no backend required). You can easily clone this repository and replace BIDARA with your own custom OpenAI Assistant. Template based on https://github.com/sveltejs/template

### Run locally
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Known issues

- deep-chat speechToText: submit command word is sent in message on safari and chrome on iOS.

- deep-chat textToSpeech: doesn't read messages aloud on safari or chrome on iOS.

### Nice to haves

- ability rate responses and add feedback.
- ability to send ratings, feedback and chat log to us.
- don't do TtS unless StT has been used.
- Proxy requests to OpenAI through an authenticated API. Users can request access. Ability to generate api keys once authenticated. Authorized API keys required to communicate with API.

- Functions:

- get pdf of paper from semantic scholar link and upload to assistant.thread.messages.files for retrieval. as a temp workaround can use openAccessPdf links to download pdfs on client, and then upload them on client directly to openai assistant.

- get all code interpreter code. useful to check its work.
