BIDARA can guide users through the Biomimicry Instituteâ€™s [Design Process](https://toolbox.biomimicry.org/methods/process/), a step-by-step method to propose biomimetic solutions to challenges. This process includes defining the problem, biologizing the challenge, discovering natural models, abstracting design strategies, and emulating nature's lessons.

## :computer: For developers

`bidara-deep-chat` uses Svelte and [the deep-chat web component](https://github.com/OvidijusParsiunas/deep-chat) to connect to BIDARA over the OpenAI Assistants API.
Template based on https://github.com/sveltejs/template

### Run locally
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Known issues

- deep-chat speechToText: submit command word is sent in message on safari and chrome on iOS.

- deep-chat textToSpeech: doesn't read messages aloud on safari or chrome on iOS.

### Nice to haves

- ability rate responses and add feedback.
- ability to send ratings, feedback and chat log to us.
- don't do TtS unless StT has been used.
- Proxy requests to OpenAI through an authenticated API. Users can request access. Ability to generate api keys once authenticated. Authorized API keys required to communicate with API.

- Functions:

- get pdf of paper from semantic scholar link and upload to assistant.thread.messages.files for retrieval. as a temp workaround can use openAccessPdf links to download pdfs on client, and then upload them on client directly to openai assistant.

- get all code interpreter code. useful to check its work.
