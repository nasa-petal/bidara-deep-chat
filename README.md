### BIDARA is a GPT-4 chatbot that was instructed to help scientists and engineers understand, learn from, and emulate the strategies used by living things to create sustainable designs and technologies.

:rocket: **[Try it out](https://nasa-petal.github.io/bidara-deep-chat/)**

BIDARA can guide users through the Biomimicry Instituteâ€™s [Design Process](https://toolbox.biomimicry.org/methods/process/), a step-by-step method to propose biomimetic solutions to challenges. This process includes defining the problem, biologizing the challenge, discovering natural models, abstracting design strategies, and emulating nature's lessons.

`bidara-deep-chat` uses [a web interface](https://github.com/OvidijusParsiunas/deep-chat) to connect to BIDARA over the OpenAI Assistants API. To use it, you need to register for [an OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) first. All messages are sent directly from your web browser to OpenAI and back.
